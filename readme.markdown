Laracon Online 2017 Notes
-------------------------

By request, here are the notes I took on some of the presentations given at Laracon
Online 2017.

Notes on Matt Stauffer's talk were added by Oleg Baranovsky ([olegvb](https://github.com/olegvb)). Thanks Oleg!

The organized links from the conference were collected by [luchaos](https://github.com/luchaos) and arranged neatly by [amsphuel](https://github.com/amsphuel). Thanks to you both!

Feel free to do what you like with these, but if anything interesting comes of whatever
you do with them, let me know.  :)
